# 📊 Old Data Analysis Projects Vault

Welcome to my archive of classic data analysis projects — the roots of my journey before I went full GenAI, RAG, and LangGraph.

This repo contains several beginner-to-intermediate projects built during my early years of learning Data Science. These are raw, experimental, and exploratory — but they're a key part of the journey.

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

This isn’t a portfolio — it’s a museum. These projects:
- Reflect my early mindset in solving data problems
- Show my growth from spreadsheets to pipelines
- Help juniors by showing “where to start”

If you’re just beginning, steal like an artist.
